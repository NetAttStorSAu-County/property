# Keeping FOIA's Honest #

---

## What This Is ##

A copy of the recent FOIA Dump (in all senses) of the County of Nassau in New York State's property assessment "guidelines" and "practices", from the efforts of those in the news above.

The idea here is to bring this Dump into wider view, thereby forcing the County to re-release this information in a more reasonable form. If they don't, then this repository's purpose is to make an effort to make it more understandable by laymen outside of the field, i.e. non-programmers.

Some personal TODOs:

  * [] Demarcate Notepad (ugh) Printed Files By Way of PDF Bookmarks
  * [] OCR Files Into Machine-Readable Format
  * [] Remove Useless Comments and Other Obfuscation
  * [] Make Compilable In More Consumer-Friendly Formats

...if I have time, of course.
